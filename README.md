# buildah-checksum

The `ADD` command in a containerfile has been supported since v1.33.0 https://buildah.io/releases/2023/11/17/Buildah-version-v1.33.0.html 

GitHub's Ubuntu 24.04 runner has v1.33.7 https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/ubuntu/Ubuntu2404-Readme.md#tools

This still fails with the error:

```
